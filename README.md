To build the operator, run:

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

## Usage

## Release

Make sure you workspace contains no uncommitted changes and then run:

```make
$ VERSION=0.18 make publish
```

That will update versions to `0.18` and push to GitHub. That will trigger a build. If that build succeeds, tag it for release:

```
$ git tag -a v0.18 -m "v0.18"
$ git push origin v0.18
```

This will trigger a release!
