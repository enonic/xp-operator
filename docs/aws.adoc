Instructions on setting up a managed Kubernetes cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS)

== Prerequisites

You will need the following:

An Amazon account:: Sign up or log in to https://aws.amazon.com/[AWS] where you will create the k8s cluster. TODO Verify

aws cli:: Command-line tool to manage resources in AWS. Get it https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html[Amazon].

eksctl:: Amazons version of Kubectl, eksctl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. Download it from https://github.com/eksctl-io/eksctl#installation[Github]



== Create an EKS cluster

image::../images/eks-create-cluster.png[Create EKS cluster]

You may create EKS clusters in many ways, we will describe the fundamentals for command line.

NOTE: The XP operator currently does not support "Fargate" compute instances (due to limitations on open files), as such you should configure your cluster with managed instances instead.

Instance type:: A recommended instance type is m5.xl (or larger).
Kubernetes version:: Should be >= 1.27.9


. Create an IAM user
. Provide it with the relevant roles
. Get the service credentials key for the user
. Create a cluster configuration file 
+
.cluster-config.yaml
[source,Yaml]
----
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig

metadata:
  name: enonic
  region: eu-north-1

managedNodeGroups:
  - name: eks-mng
    instanceType: m5.xlarge
    desiredCapacity: 1

iam:
  withOIDC: true
  serviceAccounts:
  - metadata:
      name: aws-load-balancer-controller
      namespace: kube-system
    wellKnownPolicies:
      awsLoadBalancerController: true

addons:
  - name: aws-ebs-csi-driver
    wellKnownPolicies: # Adds an IAM service account
      ebsCSIController: true

cloudWatch:
 clusterLogging:
   enableTypes: ["*"]
   logRetentionInDays: 30
----

NOTE: Replace `region` with your preferred one
+
. Then *create the cluster* with the following command:

    eksctl create cluster -f cluster-config.yaml

NOTE: AWS may take quite some time to provision the cluster

Once finished, you should see something like this in your output log:

[source,JSON]
----
2024-10-30 13:47:58 [âœ”]  EKS cluster "enonic" in "eu-north-1" region is ready
----

== Connect to the cluster

. Create a kubeconfig file with the following command
+
    aws eks update-kubeconfig --region REGION --name CLUSTER_NAME
+
. Verify you can now connect to the cluster with kubectl
+
    kubectl get namespaces
+
This should display a list of namespaces in the newly created k8s cluster. The "Age" column in the output shows how long has it been since the namespaces are created. 
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   8h
kube-node-lease   Active   8h
kube-public       Active   8h
kube-system       Active   8h
----


== Storage classes

Next step is to list available storage classes with this command:

    kubectl get storageclasses

This should display the list of storage classes provisioned by GKE cluster.

[source,terminal]
----
NAME   PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
gp2    kubernetes.io/aws-ebs   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   false                  9h
----

=== EFS

To run XP in clustered mode, a <<../storage-classes#, `ReadWriteMany` storage class>> (NFS type filesystem) is required.

You may <<nfs#, run your own NFS server>>, or take advantage of Amazon's managed service for shared filesystems called https://aws.amazon.com/efs/[Elastic File System (EFS)^]. 

To provision an EFS storage for your cluster, follow Amazons own documentation:

. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-two-create-efs-resources.html[Create an EFS^] 
. Then, https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-efs-csi-dynamic-provisioning/[create a storage class with dynamic provisioning]

Once this is configured properly, you may specify `efs` as your shared storage class when [installing the XP operator].

== Install operator

You are now ready to <<installation#, install the XP operator>> and start <<usage#, deploying XP instances>>.
