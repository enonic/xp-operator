This section briefly describes how to install and set up minikube for testing the operator.

== Prerequisites

You need to have installed these programs on your computer:

Minikube:: Is local Kubernetes, focusing on making it easy to learn and develop for Kubernetes. Download it https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/[here].

Docker:: Is a container management platform. You can use other virtual machine or container managers with Minikube, but Docker is the most preferable Minikube https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/[driver] across all operating systems. Download it https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[here].

Kubectl:: Is the Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. Download it https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[here].

== Setup

Once you have minikube working, it is quite easy to start a local cluster.

NOTE: The amount of resources you allocate to minikube will depend on your computer's capacity and the workload you intend to run on the cluster.

[source,bash]
----
$ minikube start \
	--cpus=4 \
	--memory=16gb \
	--disk-size=10gb \
    --vm-driver=docker \
	--kubernetes-version=v1.27.0

* Preparing Kubernetes v1.27.0 on Docker 27.2.0 ...
  - Generating certificates and keys ...
  - Booting up control plane ...
  - Configuring RBAC rules ...
* Verifying Kubernetes components...
* Enabled addons: storage-provisioner, default-storageclass
* Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default
----

When your cluster is up, it is good to add the ingress controller to it to test load balancing:

[source,bash]
----
$ minikube addons enable ingress

* Verifying ingress addon...
* The 'ingress' addon is enabled
----

== Verify

Verify your setup by running:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl cluster-info

Kubernetes control plane is running at https://192.168.99.252:8443
KubeDNS is running at https://192.168.99.252:8443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
----

== Teardown

Once you are done with your cluster, you can delete the machine and all the data by running:

[source,bash]
----
$ minikube delete

* Deleting "minikube" in docker ...
* Removed all traces of the "minikube" cluster.
----
