Instructions on setting up a managed k8s cluster on Microsoft Azure

== Prerequisites

You will need the following:

TODO

An Azure account:: Log in to https://portal.azure.com/[Azure]

Az CLI:: Command-line tool to manage resources in Azure. Download it TODO

Kubectl:: The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. Download it from https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[Kubernetes.io].


== Create an AKS cluster

TODO

. *Enable the Kubernetes Engine API*. If the kubernetes engine API is not enabled for your GCP project, you need to enable it. 
+

+
. Click btn:[Create] to launch the k8s cluster wizard. 
+
image::../images/gkeCreateClusterPage.png[Create GKE Cluster]
+
. Follow the cluster creation steps by setting the values based on your cluster needs. 
+
WARNING: Make sure to chose kubernetes version >= 1.27 which is requried by XP operator.


== Connect to the cluster

TODO

. Once the k8s cluster is created, click the cluster name
. Then click btn:[Connect] on the top middle section of the page. This shows you the gcloud command you can use to connect to the k8s cluster from your computer.
. Copy and run the gcloud command. If the command outputs `kubeconfig entry generated for <newly-created-k8s-cluster-name>`, it means proper kubectl config is generated on your computer and you are successfully authenticated to the k8s cluster. 
. To verify your access to the k8s cluster run the command
+
[source,terminal]
----
kubectl get namespaces
----
+
This should display the list of namespaces in the newly created k8s cluster. The "Age" column in the output shows how long has it been since the namespaces are created. 


== Storage classes

When connected to your cluster, list the available storage classes with this command:

[source,terminal]
----
kubectl get storageclasses
----

TODO: Example

This should display the list of storage classes provisioned by GKE cluster.

=== TODO

To run XP in cluster mode, a <<../storage-classes#, `ReadWriteMany` storage class>> (NFS type filesystem) must exist.

Azure offers a managed service for shared filesystems called https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/files[Azure Files^], which can be used to provision an NFS filesystem to your AKS cluster. 

A cost effective alternative is to <<nfs#, run your own NFS server>>. 


TODO? Does Azure files work?


To provision an EFS storage, you will need the
