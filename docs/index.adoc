:toc: right
:imagesdir: images

The Enonic XP Operator lets you deploy XP instances on Kubernetes (k8s) with ease. It builds on the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/[operator pattern] provided by Kubernetes.

== Motivation

Creating a simple XP deployment is quite easy, but it quickly gets more complicated when you try to create production grade clusters. Add to that the complexity of Kubernetes, and you can quickly get into trouble. The makes it easy to create and manage complex deployments.

== Usage

Take a look at the <<usage#,usage>> section see how to use the operator.

== Installation

The operator must be installed on a properly configured k8s cluster.

Follow our <<installation#,installation guide>> to get started.

NOTE: If you need to set up a local test environment, have a look at our <<minikube#,minikube guide>>.

== Supported XP versions

NOTE: The operator only supports Enonic XP `v7.13.2` and newer.
