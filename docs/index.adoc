== Introduction

Creating a single-instance XP deployment is easy, but managing production grade XP clusters is more complex. Add to that the complexity of Kubernetes, and you can quickly get into trouble. The operator simplifies this.

NOTE: The operator only supports Enonic XP `v7.13.2` and newer.




== Installation

The operator must be installed on a properly configured k8s cluster.

Follow our <<installation#,installation guide>> to get started.

NOTE: If you need to set up a local test environment, have a look at our <<minikube#,minikube guide>>.
