Instructions on setting up a managed k8s cluster on the Google Cloud Platform

== Prerequisites

You will need the following:

A Google account and project:: Log in to https://cloud.google.com[GCP], and select or create a `Project` where you will create the k8s cluster. 

Gcloud:: The Google Cloud CLI. Visit https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install for instructions to install.

Kubectl:: The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. Download it from https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[Kubernetes.io].


== Create a GKE Cluster

. *Enable the Kubernetes Engine API*
+
If the kubernetes engine API is not enabled for your GCP project, you need to enable it from the GCP console
+
image::../images/gkeEnablek8sapi.png[Enable API]
+
NOTE: The XP Operator *does not support Autopilot clusters*, so we will need to create the cluster from command line.
+
. *Connect gcloud to your project*
+
    gcloud auth login
    gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>

. *Create the cluster*
+
Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
gcloud container clusters create mygkecluster \
    --release-channel regular \
    --zone europe-north1-c \
    --node-locations europe-north1-c,
----
+
This will create a cluster called `mygkecluster` in the europe-north1 region, using zone c. For more details check out Googles own docs.


== Connect kubectl

Once the k8s cluster is created, you can test connecting to it

. From the Cluster details page in the Google console, click btn:[Connect] on the top of the page. This shows you the gcloud command you can use to connect to the k8s cluster from your computer. It should look something like this:
+
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials mygkecluster --zone europe-north1-c --project <PROJECT_ID>
+
. Copy and run the gcloud command.
+
If the output says `kubeconfig entry generated for mygkecluster`, you are good to go. 
+
. To verify your access to the k8s cluster run the command
+
[source,terminal]
----
kubectl get namespaces
----
+
This should display the list of namespaces in the newly created k8s cluster. The "Age" column in the output shows how long has it been since the namespaces are created. 


== Node pool

The cluster is created with a default node pool, using VMs (nodes) that are not suitable for running XP.

. To fix this, simply *create a new node pool*:
+
[source,terminal]
----
gcloud container node-pools create custom-pool \
  --cluster=mygkecluster\
  --machine-type=n2-standard-4 \
  --num-nodes=1 \
  --enable-autoscaling \
  --min-nodes=1 --max-nodes=10 \
  --zone=europe-north1-c
----
+
The new pool is based on 4vCPU VMs, suitable for production grade deployments of Enonic XP.
+
. When done, you may *delete the old node pool*:
+
[source,terminal]
----
gcloud container node-pools delete default-pool \
  --cluster=mygkecluster\
  --zone=europe-north1-c
----
+
NOTE: These operation can also be done directly from the Cloud console UI.



== Storage classes

XP will require specific storage classes in order to work properly. List the available storage classes using the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
kubectl get storageclasses
----

Output should look something like this:

[source,terminal]
----
NAME                     PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
premium-rwo              pd.csi.storage.gke.io   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   true                   89m
standard                 kubernetes.io/gce-pd    Delete          Immediate              true                   89m
standard-rwo (default)   pd.csi.storage.gke.io   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   true                   89m
----

NOTE: We recommend using `standard-rwo` or `premium-rwo` when deploying XP.

=== Shared storage

If you plan to run XP clusters, you will also need a ReadWriteMany (RWM) storage class. 

A cost effective solution is to <<nfs#, deploy an NFS server>> in your cluster. Google also offers a managed RWM via the https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/persistent-volumes/filestore-csi-driver[Filestore CSI driver]. For more details, visit the <<storage#, storage chapter>>.

== Install operator

You are now ready to <<installation#, install the XP operator>> and start <<usage#, deploying XP instances>>.
